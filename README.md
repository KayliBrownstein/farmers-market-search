# Getting Started
This is a Farmers' Market Search app. It uses React and has a Sinatra backend.

You'll need to run the following commands to start the app.

`npm install`
`bundle install`

Then in order to get the application up and running you have to open up two
tabs and run `ruby server.rb` in one and `npm start` in the other. Open up `localhost:4567` in your browser.

The app is also available on Heroku: http://farmers-market-search.herokuapp.com/.
